# WaterApp
Class group project that allows users to submit and view reports about water availability and quality.

This project was created by a group of 5 students for a class at Georgia Tech. We worked together to design, analyse, and develop this application to meet the class requirements. Some features (or lack of features) and design choices do not reflect what a similar real-world application would actually look like as we only had to meet certain requirements for the class.

The application allows users to view water availability and quality information on a Google Maps interface. Users are also able to submit reports about the availability of water.

There are also higher level users, named workers and managers, that are allowed to submit more detailed information, delete reports, and view graphs of report data.
